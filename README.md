# Asteroids

This is my take on the classic arcade space shooted Asteroids by Atari.
In the game the player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers.
The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either,
or being hit by the saucers counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.
